{"changed":true,"filter":false,"title":"README.md","tooltip":"/README.md","value":"BakeBook\n'BakeBook' is a recipe collection site for a community of bakers. The intention is to share baking recipes with others as well as save your own\ncollection of recipes. As a baker myself I enjoy finding new recipes to try out, however curating all of the recipes I find online\ncan be tricky, especially if I have added my own twists to them. This site aims to make that process easier as well as allowing the baking community\nto discover tried and tested recipes from others.\n\nUX\nTo begin with I started brainstorming who would want to use this site and how they would want to use it. To aid in this process I cam up with several user stories.\nThey are as follows:\n\nAs a baker, I want to store my recipes in one place online, so that I can easily find them again.\nAs an aspiring baker, I want to find a tried and tested chocolate cake recipe so I can make one for myself.\nAs a member of the BakeBook community I want to be able to save my favourite recipes from the collection so I can find them later.\nAs a member of the BakeBook community I want to be able to add my own recipes, edit them and delete them so others can try them out.\n\nAs part of this design process I also created some wireframes which can be viewed here:\n\nFeatures\n\nExisting Features\n\nThe Homepage:\nThe homepage is what displays when a user first goes to the site to view the recipes. This page shows the recipes in the database in card form\nwith their alloted image above, their title and subtitle and a link to 'view the recipe' in a larger format. User login is not required\nto view this page.\n\nRecipe View:\nWhen a user clicks on 'View the recipe' they are taken to a new page with the full recipe including the image, title, subtitle, ingredients and method.\nUser login is not required to view full recipes.\n\nSubmit a recipe:\n\nEdit a recipe:\n\nDelete a recipe:\n\nSave a recipe:\n\nSearch for a recipe:\n\nLogin / Sign Up:\n\nFeature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z\n...\nFor some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.\n\nIn addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:\n\nFeatures Left to Implement\nRating system:\n\nAnother feature idea\nComment section:\n\nTechnologies Used\nIn this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.\n\nJQuery\nThe project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.\nTesting\nIn this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.\n\nWhenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.\n\nFor any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:\n\nContact form:\nGo to the \"Contact Us\" page\nTry to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears\nTry to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears\nTry to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.\nIn addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.\n\nYou should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.\n\nIf this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.\n\nDeployment\nThis section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).\n\nIn particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:\n\nDifferent values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?\nDifferent configuration files?\nSeparate git branch?\nIn addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.\n\nCredits\nContent\nThe text for section Y was copied from the Wikipedia article Z\nMedia\nThe photos used in this site were obtained from ...\nAcknowledgements\nI received inspiration for this project from X","undoManager":{"mark":-1,"position":-1,"stack":[]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":1070,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":53,"column":0},"end":{"row":53,"column":0},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":75,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/markdown"}},"timestamp":1567445882509}
